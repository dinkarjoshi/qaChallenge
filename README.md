The framework can be run by maven command:
mvn test -Pdj_main

dj_main is the profile which maps testng.xml , which further contains all the classes.

The framework also contains reporting structure.

Please visit folder -> myStore->reports and open the latest html file generated post mvn run.

The above can be implemented in Jenkins for CI CD.
